## Overview

Webplay is a simple, fun to play web game.

## How To Play

You will see random letters on your screen. Write the first word that
comes to your mind that starts with that letter. You will have 5
seconds to write a word, after that another word pops up and do the
same. You can't repeat a word and the game ends when you failed to
write a word in the time limit. Ready to play? Have fun!
